# Solo Project Presentation Outline

Solo project presentations should take 2-3 minutes.

- What problem are you solving?
    - Make the audience understand the struggle that exists today
    - Tell a story
    - Example:
        > Earlier today my brother Riley asked me to pick up some bananas from the store. I said yes, but I also remember I was supposed to pick something up for my sister Tanya. Now that I'm at the store I can't remember what it was!
- What is the solution?
    - Continue telling your story
    - Example:
        > I can never remember all of the things I was supposed to pick up for my siblings, so I created "Super Shopper." Now Riley and Tanya can add items to this list, and I don't need to worry about forgetting anything!
        
        
- Demo your app! (~2 minutes)
    - Talk through the process of what a user would do in your app. 
        -  Keep it from their perspective
            - "When a store owner logs in, they see their portfolo page with all their items!"
            
- Which technologies did you use?
    - Keep this brief. 
    - Technologies used by many students can be mentioned quickly without explanation
        - Example:
            > I used React, Redux, Node, Express, and Bootstrap.

    - Technologies only a few students are familiar with or not everyone used should be given a sentence
        - Example:
            > I used the Twilio API to send text messages.
            
- What was the toughest challenge you overcame?
    - This should be a success story. This should not be a complaint or beating yourself up. Remember, this is in-part practice for describing your project to recruiters and potential employers.
    - Example:
        > The toughest challenge I overcame was synchronizing all of the lists accross multiple users so that nothing was left off the list or overwritten.
- What is the 1 (one) next thing you are excited to tackle
    - This is to build excitement around your application.
    - This is not time for you to list all of the things you wish you would have accomplished.
    - Only 1 (ONE) thing should be listed here.
    - Example:
        > Now that the synchronized list is working, the next challenge I really excited to tackle push notifications to alert my siblings that I'm about to go to the store, so they should add items to the list soon!
        
        
 - Say thanks!
